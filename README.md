# Zero-Knowledge Proof-Based Authentication on Blockchain

## Overview
This project provides a secure, blockchain-based authentication system using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Users can prove their identity without revealing sensitive information, enhancing both privacy and security.

## Features
- User registration and login using ZKP.
- Decentralized verification through blockchain.
- Privacy-preserving authentication.

## How It Works
1. **User Registration**: Users register by creating a unique public key.
2. **Authentication**: Users generate a proof using their private key.
3. **Verification**: The blockchain smart contract verifies the proof against the stored public key hash.

## Quick Setup and Run Example

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IncognitoJR-007/ZKAuth-Blockchain.git
   cd ZKAuth-Blockchain

2. **Install Dependencies (if using Python): Create a `requirements.txt` (if you have dependencies) and run:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Backend:**
   ```bash
   python backend/auth.py

4. **Open the Frontend:**
• Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser.

5. **Use the Application:**
• Enter your `username` and `private key`.

• Click `Start Game` to generate a proof


## Example Usage:
• Username: `test_user`

• Private Key: `my_secret_key`

## Output:
• Proof generated and registered for the user.
